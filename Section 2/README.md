# After our first lines of codes. Now we will be going deep on GoLang.

## Declaring variables

- Go is a staticly typed language. When we create a new variable, we have to set it's type.
  ```go
    var name string = "Selcuk"
  ```
  With this line of code. We are creating a variable typed 'string' and named 'name' and assing 'Selcuk' to it. The 'var' keyword means this is a variable.
- Basic variable types in Go
  - bool -> true or false
  - string -> sequence of characters
  - int -> integer numbers
  - float64 -> 64bit floating point numbers
