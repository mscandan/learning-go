# In this repo I will share my Golang learning experience.

## Why I wanted to learn Go?

- Code written in Go is easy to maintain.
- Simple scoping rules.
- Go routines
- Built-in garbage collection.
- My personal interest of backend development.

## My Learning Sources

- [Udemy Course by Stephen Grider for Basics of GoLang](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/)
- [YouTube Series by TECH SCHOOL for Implementing RESTAPI with GoLang and PostreSQL](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy_6D98if3ULEtXtNSY_2qN21VCKgoQAE)

### I will try to update this repository with the sources I've used to learn as much as possible.
